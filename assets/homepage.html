										<I>I've skated off and on since 1975.
											<p>I grew up 5 blocks from Brentwood school in West L.A., <A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLBH9ACwouE" target="_blank">
													learned to skate on the asphalt banks there</A>, and the world you see 
												documented in <I>Dogtown and Z-Boys</I> pretty much describes the world I grew 
												up in (except that we lived on the "right" side of Wilshire Blvd, which meant 
												that I grew up better educated but never developed the skate skills of the guys 
												we idolized - Tony Alva and Jay Adams and their posse.</p>
											<p>In 1978, <A href="assets/1978Contest/Contest_Award_small.JPG" target="_blank">I placed 5th</A> in the Bay Street freestyle 
												competition in Santa Monica, California. That was the peak of my skating 
												career. Today, I'm a parks-n-pools skater, and I'm better than I ever was in 
												the 70's, 80's (most of which I sat out in a small town with little to skate 
												on), or 90's</p>
											<P>
											Lately, I've become involved in skatepark advocacy - trying to help public 
											organizations create quality, cost-effective skateparks that will meet the 
											needs of all levels of skateboarders for years to come.&nbsp;
