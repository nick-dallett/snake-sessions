<H1>The Oregon Trip, September 2003</H1>

<P>I had too much vacation time accumulated at work, and I haven’t yet had a chance to skate most of the incredible skateparks that Dreamland has been putting together in Oregon, so I decided to take a week off just to slope and skate.  I talked brother-in-law Matt into doing the trip with me.  The Port Townsend friend we both love to hang out and skate with, Dax, lives in Beaverton these days, so we called him up.  His offer to let us crash at his place rounded out our plans.

<P>Over the course of six days, we hit 9 incredible skateparks in the North end of the state.  Time pressure prevented us going as far South as we’d have liked (so we had to miss Medford, Klamath Falls, Port Orford, Waldport, etc…), but the parks we did skate left us with indelible memories and only a few bruises.

<H1>Trip Report</H1>
<H2>Sunday 9-14-2003</H2>

<H3>Woodinville</H3>
<P>Got up early and went to Woodinville to warm up.  Then back to the house to have donuts with the girls before heading out.

<H3>Olympia</H3>
<P>On the way down South, we stopped at Olympia for about a ½ hour.  I’d never been to the Olympia park before.  Kind of a nice little park – the round bowl in the back has nice transitions, but very small – 3’ or 4’?  If it was about 6’, it would be really nice.

<H3>Hood River</H3>
<P>The Columbia gorge area is absolutely gorgeous.  On the road to and from Hood River, I kept thinking “This would be worth the drive just for the scenery.”  Hood River is small enough that we just stopped at a gas station and asked where the park was.  The guy told us it was just down the road – hit the Subway and turn left.  So we did, and there it was. Hood River has two half pipes – both vert – one about 12’, and one about 8’.  The 8’ looked promising, except for a loose piece of ply at the bottom that looked super sketchy.  Anyway, I had a different agenda.

<P>The bowl at Hood River is super fast and super smooth.  It’s also incredibly tight – there is almost no flatbottom.  Rolling into it reminded me of the waterfall at Upland.  There was a kid – maybe 9 or 10? – just learning how to drop in when I got there.  He was doing great, and he was getting all the way into the bowl and carving around after a few tries.  Then I dropped in, and bit it a few times before I got used to the speed.

<P>It took me a while to get comfortable with the speed and find some lines.  Luckily I’m used to tight bowls – Hood River is sort of like Renton, if they’d made it a foot or two deeper, added a second capsule off to the side, and done the concrete work right.  It’s also sort of like Fontana, if you squashed Fontana sideways and deflated the two smaller ends of the combi.

<P>I got winded quickly and spent some time recuperating in the little reservoir area just down from the bowl.  It’s tiny, but it’s really fun – it’s sloped just right so you can get into a grind, and grind right around a corner, keeping your speed.  Nice :).  Matt was ripping it up there – I saw him nail a long frontside 50-50 around the corner.  I can’t hold those very long at all.

<P>Back to the bowl.  I got warmed up again.  Had a little scare, because my knee started hurting like a ligament was pulled.  This happens to me occasionally when I’m not warmed up, so I took it easy for a bit and it went away.   I started getting higher in the bowl, but still not getting to the coping.   A couple of other guys showed up, and I watched their lines.   Taking their example, I tried dropping in a little more to the left, which gave me a much more natural line into the bowl and back around the two smaller bowls.  Yes!  Matt said I was getting much closer to coping now.  He got some snaps and a video.

<P>I talked Matt into getting into the bowl.  He was sketched out at first, but after a couple of runs he was carving the wall nicely.  After a rest, he even got the courage to drop in.  He did great - I’ll make a bowlrider of him yet.

<P>The Hood River bowl has an annoying tendency to accumulate pine needles, being under several of those trees.  I suggested a rule that each skater grab a handful of needles on their way out of the bowl.

<P>After about 2 hours, we were getting tired, so we packed up and headed out.  We decided to wait on lunch/dinner until we got to Portland, so that we could eat with Dax.

<P>I’m really sad to report that we hit an animal on the road on the way home.  It was a large brown teddy bear that looked like it had just been lost from a car along with a bunch of other toys and household items.  It was in the middle of the lane and I tried to avoid it by going directly over it, but the car wouldn’t clear it, so there was a bump, and I saw a cloud of foam stuffing in the rearview :(.

<H3>Hillsboro</H3>

<P>Got to Dax’s and had some food.  We kicked back and watched some video, including the pix and video from the day’s adventures so far.  Dax said that the Hillsboro park near his house was pretty nice, so we decided to go have a late afternoon session there.  Since it wasn’t one of the parks on my list of parks to check out, I didn’t think there would be much to it.  Boy was I wrong – Hillsboro is a pretty sick park – much better than most of the little Washington parks I usually skate.  These Oregoners think big.  Hillsboro is largely street-oriented, but there are lots of banks, and the whole North end of the park is bowled, with about 8-foot walls.  After a few tentative runs, I found a nice long line and made Matt take some snaps of me.  I was able to get some serious speed.  If I had a few more skills, or maybe just some balls, I could have easily transferred over the 6’ spine.  

<H3>Manual pad</H3>
<P>Went and grabbed a burger, and then we went to a mall near Dax’s place to skate a manual pad he likes.  It’s a median in the middle of the Office Depot parking lot in Beaverton.  It’s a really shallow curb, so it’s easy to ollie onto.  I watched from the car, munching on my burger.  Then I got out and tried skating some street.  Man, I was tired and stiff.  I couldn’t even ollie at first.  But by the end of the session, I was able to ollie up the curb into a manual (a first for me), and manual across the pad and off.  OK, so my tail dragged a lot of the time, but hey, this was quite a step up for me in the street skating dept.

<P>Back to Dax’s to watch skate videos and  veg.  I was badlky dehydrated and spent most of the night trying to catch back up.  Finally got to see P.J. Ladd’s Wonderful Horrible Life.  I wasn’t very impressed – I’d really had it built up to me.

<H2>Monday, September 15</H2>
<H3>Newburg</H3>
<P>We were going to hit Burnside this morning, but  Matt was exhausted, so I let him sleep in while I cleaned Dax’s apartment – dishes, garbage, recycling (damn, we forgot to buy him a toilet brush on our way home yesterday…).  So we took off around 9 and headed South towards Newburg.   We took 217 from Beaverton, but it wasn’t on our map, so we wound up getting lost. We thought we were going to take 219 straight down to Newburg, but that didn’t work out.  Then I missed the turn onto 99w, so we headed North on I-5 looking for it.  Wound up in Portland again, and drove around lost for quite a while before we finally got on the right road.

<P>About 10 miles to Newburg, there were a couple of kids on skateboard hitchhiking, so we picked them up.  They were street skaters from Newburg.  We dropped one of them off at school, and the other at his house, a few blocks from the park.  That’s two good deeds today – cleaning Dax’s and giving the kids a ride. 

<P>One of the kids was a grower and talked about his crop.  He asked Matt at one point if we were looking to buy weed.  Matt’s not smoking these days, and I rarely do, so we declined.

<P>Pulling up to Newburg was akin to pulling up to a beach and seeing 20 foot glassy peelers off the beach – from the parking lot, you can see wave after wave of towering concrete receding into the distance.  

<P>We were both exhausted from the day before, so we eased into the park slowly.  Matt wasn’t sure he was going to skate at all.  However, by the end of the day I saw a transformation take place, and Matt was starting to outskate me, giggling like a madman.  He was pulling off frontside 50-50s better than mine, and frontside standup 5-0s,  which I can’t do at all.

<P>Helmets are required at Newburg, and this is enforced by people who live in a house on-site.  They did a walkthrough from time to time.  One of the skaters there, Gar, had a trunk full of spare helmets, and he loaned Matt one – a Pro-Tec with a “snowboarders suck” sticker on the front of it, along with a bunch of stuff about smoking moneys.  Gar was ripping the place up – huge transfers all over the place, no-grab ollie airs off the top of the big vert – super-sick.  I spent some time snapping shots of him.

<P>Big vert scares the hell out of me, but I warmed up to it and was cruising around, doing no tricks except my ubiquitous tailtaps.  The capsule at the end of the vert section is smooth and flowing – skating it was like coming.

<P>Gar left, which meant no more skating for Matt, since the helmet left with him.  However, as Gar left, Rick showed up, and pretty soon Matt was skating again in his very own helmet – an old Helmet Rick had which he gave Matt outright.  Like everyone at Newburg, Rick was super-nice, and we talked with him for a while.

<H3>Donald</H3>
<P>We left Newburg and had Chinese food at the Lucky Fortune (?), then went south to Donald.  My fortune was something like “know your fears and you have true luck”.

<P>Donald is just a kidney pool plopped into a tiny little skatepark next to a little miniramp.  There were several juds playing around in the pool, staying in the shallow end.  I loved Donald and would like to go back.  I was just getting over my dehydration and exhaustion, and started to really enjoy myself, but I was still tired, so we didn’t stay long.

<P>There was a woman there on a purple kids bike who was yelling at her kid “hey, get out a yer aunt Kristin’s yard!”  White trash to the core.  Her kid – maybe 4 years old – was lying in a heap in the middle of a lane of the road, refusing to budge.  She didn’t seem to care – she was sitting on her bike maybe a half a block away, yelling at him from time to time.  I was appalled. I finally went over and picked him up and moved him off the road.  Neither he nor his mom said anything.  Thanks god there is very little traffic in Donald.

<P>On the way back to Beaverton, a car ahead of us started to make terrible noises and pulled off the road.  We swung around and went back to see if we could help, rounding out our quartet of good deeds for the day.

<P>Came back to Beaverton and went to see “Once upon a time in Mexico,” the latest in the series that began with El Mariachi and continued with Desperado.   Bad movie.  Inappropriate humor, inappropriate violence, bad or no acting, and not enough of Salma Hayek.  The plot was impossible to follow. 

<H2>Tuesday, September 16</H2>
<H3>Lincoln City</H3>

<P>When we got up on Tuesday morning, it had rained overnight and the ground was wet. Made me glad we were heading out to the coast, to a covered and very unique park.

<P>Originally, I had wanted to go camp out on the coast and hit several parks.  However, some of the guys at Newburg had told us that it was only an hour’s drive out to Lincoln City, which meant that it could easily be done as a day trip.  So, we left the sleeping bags at Dax’s and headed out.  Turned out the guys were off by a bit – rather than the fifty-something miles that they had estimated, it turned out to be over 80 miles to Lincoln City.  With the low speed limits and traffic through many of the little towns on the way, it took us about 2 hours to get there.

<P>Coming over the pass on our way to the coast, it started to rain.  It quickly went from mild sprinkling to some of the hardest rain I’ve ever had to drive through.  I was getting worried that even the covered area at Lincoln City would be wet.

<P>When we got to the park, my fears were realized.  The rain soaked the park up to the covered area, and as we walked up to the park, I could see that the rain had dripped into the park, wetting both bowls.  As I peered over the edge, I saw a trickle of water starting to roll down into the cradle.  I sprinted back to the car to get the squeegee.  I sprinted back to the park. I slid down into the bowl, and, off-balance, crashed and rolled on the flatbottom. Hit my arm so badly that it was sore for the rest of the week.

<P>I dusted myself off and started squeegeeing.  I figured maybe I could dry out enough to be able to skate a limited portion of the park.  To my delight, the smooth, well-sealed concrete started to dry as soon as it had been squeeged.  

<P>Within about 20 minutes, the rain had stopped, the sun came out, and my squeegee efforts had resulted in an almost-dry park.  

<P>Riding the cradle feels very like the capsule end at Newburg – a swooping rush and release that you feel right down to your toes.  I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to cruise in and slingshot around.  I’d been afraid that I would not be able to get past the line that demarcates the vertical horizon of the sphere, but I was over it my second or third try, and soon I was more than a foot past vert.  

<P>Lincoln City really brought out the best in me.  It took a little effort to get used to the transitions – L.C. is basically a snake run with no flatbottom.  It has a semicircular profile and super-smooth ‘crete.  As a matter of fact, skating it was amazingly like skating the new Upland pipeline.  Soon I was hitting grinds on either side of the run, and cruising up to coping in the big bowl.  After a while, I was getting backside stalls on the two small bowls.  And at the end of each run, the cradle awaited to slingshot me around for another go.

<P>On my way out of the big bowl towards the middle of my run, I was coming up the wall with tremendous horizontal speed, and I started throwing frontside airs.  With a little more speed vertically, I’m sure I could have brought them out of the bowl, but I didn’t have that kind of confidence yet.  Still, it was overall my best park skating ever.  I could tell the improvement that the previous days’ skating had brought.

<P>Matt enjoyed the park as well – after a couple of runs, he was having enormous fun.  Before I could get the camera out and get his picture, though, he cruised through the big bowl and twisted at a strange angle, doing something nasty to his left knee.  It was an injury that mostly sidelined him for the next couple of days.
The weather continued to improve – clouds dissolving away – until it was dry enough to skate the upper, uncovered section of the park.  This part has seen better days – the ‘crete is worn and granular, which slows down hard park wheels like the ones I ride.  I considered swapping out my wheels and riding my ABEC11 92s, but I was tired and ready for lunch, so I put up with the rough ride for a few minutes until we were ready to go.

<P>There were a couple of kids in a car, and they offered to sell us more bud.  Ah Oregon, land of agriculture!

<H3>Newport</H3>
<UL><I>
“You can never escape
<BR>You can only move South down the coast”

</I><UL>-Counting Crows, <I>Mrs. Potter’s Lullabye</I></UL>
</UL>

<P>After lunch at Subway (skate fresh!), we headed down the coast towards Newport.  The Oregon coast was gorgeous – as a matter of fact, the entire drive through farm country, and then old-growth forest, and then the coast, was breathtaking.   We owed to stop and take lots of pictures on the way back.

<P>Newport has a small park, and when we got out of the car, I wondered why we had driven the extra twentysomething miles.  Matt Johnston had strongly recommended Newport (“It’s only 20 miles from Lincoln City – you’ll love it!”), though he’d warned about sand in the bottom of the bowl.  At Newburg, Gar had given us the same warning about sand on the coping at Newburg.  It was easy to see whence the warnings.  The Newport park is a block or two from the beach, and it’s part of a park that’s pretty much built on sand dunes.  There was a healthy pile of sand in the middle of the park.  I had a dustpan in the car, but we soon discovered that it was easy to skate around the sand piles, so we let this natural phenomenon be.

<P>I can see why Matt insisted that we go the extra way to skate Newport.  It was small, but it was fast and fun.  After a bit of getting used to it, I was whipping around the big bowl backside, and cruising across the sandy-bottomed portion for some big backside 50-50s on the opposite wall.  I was very stoked – I was getting better grinds than usual, and really feeling the improvement that had begin in Lincoln City.

<P>Matt took some runs as well and had lots of fun, although he soon stopped due to the tweaked knee.  

<P>Not long after we arrived, school let out, and it was like the sky opened up to let it rain kids.  Pretty soon, we were overrun with skaters.  I dropped out of skater mode and into photographer mode.  

<P>I swear I haven’t seen anyone do a Benihana since the early 1990s, but every single kid at Newport was doing them.  It’s the local trick – a sort of disjoint population formed by geographical boundaries and some evolutionary quirk.

<P>It was getting on towards 4:30, and we elected to head home.  I was heartsick about not getting to skate Waldport, another 30-something miles further South.  I kicked myself for not bringing the sleeping bags, because we could had easily driven down to Waldport and bivvied down for the night.  Waldport is brand new and has a unique parabolic bowl which I really wanted to try out.  However, it seemed the better part of valor to head back to Beaverton.

<P>We stopped at the factory stores in Lincoln City, and I bought a ouple of pair of new shoes, including a pair of shockingly white Reebok hightops, which looked like they came straight out of a Bones Brigade video from the 80s.

<P>Sadly, The Barking Dog organic farm was closed for the season.  However, we stopped at an organic vegetable stand in Sheridan, lured by the promise of fresh local blueberries.  It turned out to be a bait-and-switch – they had sold out of blueberries earlier that day.  However, I did buy some nectarines and we picked up several kinds of pepper (including some cayennes), zucchinis, and onion, which I sautéed into a wonderful dinner when we returned home.
<H2>Wednesday September 17</H2>
<H3>West Linn</H3>
<P>We had several options lined up for Wednesday.  As it turned out, Dax didn’t have to work until 2:30, so we decided to go skate West Linn in the early morning, head South to Aumsville for a bit, and then drive Dax home and chill for the rest of the day.

<P>West Linn is Oregon’s only Grindline park, and I was really looking forward to skating there.  I’ve skated all of Grindline’s public Washington parks – Ballard, Bainbridge, Orcas Island, and Sumner – and I really appreciate what they do with cement and pool coping.

<P>West Linn is in what looks like a swanky residential neighborhood.  Odd place for a skatepark – usually they’re out of the way, in industrial or commercial areas.  We got there a little before 8 AM and found a locked gate with a sign saying the park opened at 9.  The fence was all of 4 feet high, so we hopped it and started to skate (the guy showed up to unlock the gate at 8:30 and didn’t even acknowledge our presence).

<P>I was somewhat disappointed by this park.  It didn’t have quite the flow I’ve come to expect from Gridline.  However, it was a unique piece of skate art, and I soon found some lines I could enjoy.

<P>West Linn is like one of those toddler rides at Disneyland, where you take all kinds of twists and turns, and doors open suddenly in front of you.  You drop in down a sort of bobsled run into one bowl, into an over-vert section which is impossible to get enough speed to hit, sadly, and then you cascade (much like Maui’s seven sacred pools at Hana) into two more bowls.  The deep bowl is aggressively vert, with a very sharp transition which I never really got the feel of.  My favorite section was the middle (next-to-last) bowl, where I found a nice spot for some backside grinds.  Then I picked out the corner of this bowl for some frontside Bertlemans, and it proved a perfect location for that trick.

<P>Matt took about three runs at West Linn before he got angry at his twisted knee and threw the worst tantrum I’ve seen from him.  He was throwing his board around and screaming.  Finally, he stomped his board repeatedly until it broke into two pieces, and threw them onto the deck.  After a long cool-down period during which he disappeared from the park for a while, he came back and shot photos of Dax floating ollies across the various pyramids scattered around the park.

<P>Dax still looks like a huge raptor when he ollies.  We officially christened him “Condor” at West Linn.
<H3>Aumsville</H3>
<P>On to Aumsville, another one of Dreamland’s famous parks.  This is the park in the film “Northwest”, where Ben Krahn has the incredible solo session that seems to never end.

<P>Aumsville is incredible.  My two word park review after one run was “daddy like.”  Incredible flow, and plenty of speed to hit every wall.

<P>Unfortunately, we had forgotten the water jugs at home before we headed out, and I wasn’t drinking enough during my run at West Linn, so I was starting to feel the effects of dehydration when we got to Aumsville.  Then, on my attempt to drop in on the vert wall, I slid out, and after that, my legs were shaking.  At first I blamed fear and the fall, but I soon figured out that I was bonking bad.  We had gotten a couple of gallons of water at the Safeway near West Linn when we left, so I started hitting that pretty hard.  I ate a banana, and within about 20 minutes I was feeling better.  I rebounded enough for Dax to shoot some pictures, but I was not done with that park when we had to leave to get Dax back for work.

<P>Matt and I headed out to Reo’s Ribs, which we’d seen several times on Canyon road.  We had some incredible barbecue sandwiches, cornbread, and sweet potato pie tartlets.  Note to self – pick up some of those tartlets for Jac before heading home.  I asked the owner whether he knew Gene Porter of Dixie’s barbecue in Bellevue.  He said he hadn’t, but he has heard of “The Man.”

<P>Back to Dax’s for a long nap, and we whiled away the afternoon and evening playing THPS4 and watching “Destroying America” (appalling, but somehow impossible not to gawk at).

<H2>Thursday, September 18</H2>
<P>Thursday was Dax’s day off, so we planned to have him along for the whole day.
<H3>Burnside</H3>
<P>This is the original, the first and most famous of the skater-built parks in Oregon, maybe the first and most famous in the world.  Matt slept in while Dax and I went early to skate.

<P>Burnside is badass.  The concrete work is lumpy, there are unfinished sections that you don’t want to skate near, and the park is always crowded.  Mornings are ruled by the BMXers – despite the early hour, there were probably 8 bikers there by the time we left, and about 3 skaters.

<P>It took me a while to get into the park, and I never quite got comfortable.  Burnside is one of those must-skate spots (sort of like the Baldy pipeline in SoCal), but it is not my favorite place to skate.

<P>While I was there, I pitched forward while doing a rockover on the tiny little spine, and slammed on my knee and wristguardless wrist (ow!).  Then, while trying to do a tailtap on one of the roof supports, I came down with one foot on the board, and one on the pier.  This turned into a fast and sickening splits which stretched my legs further than they wanted to go.  Ow.  I wasn’t sure I’d be able to skate again after that, but I actually bounced back quite quickly.  Funny thing, I was far more limber after that and my skating was better all day.

<P>We tried to go by Cal’s Pharmacy after we left (while in Oregon, I wanted to get some decent pads), but they were closed, with no indication of what time they opened. 

<P>We stopped at Whole Foods, where Dax works, and picked up stuff for breakfast.  I finally got to meet Dax’s fiancee, Amanda

<H3>Newburg</H3>
<P>I was glad to get to skate Newburg again.  My first time, I was in really bad shape.  This time, I was feeling great, and I was able to take full advantage of the size and speed of this park.  My comfort with big vert had increased, and skating the deep section felt like big wave surfing.  One run, I suddenly had so much speed, I was headed straight for the coping.  However, I was out of control, so I bailed and let myself slide down the wall.  That’s the second time I’ve had that happen – the first was at Ballard, the time I inadvertently got a wheeler in the deep end.  Shows that I have the speed and ability to hit coping on the big vert, but I don’t know quite how to unlock that ability on a predictable, controlled basis.

<P>Matt was back in the saddle, and was doing some amazing skating.  He was getting some great frontside grinds in the shallow end.

<P>He also took one of the worst slams I’ve ever seen.  He took the concrete directly to the face and, incredibly, walked away and skated again.  I’d say it was lucky he had a helmet, but watching the video in slow motion (yes, I was actually filming video at the time!), you can see his helmet fly off, and it’s about a foot away from his head before his head makes contact with the ground.

<P>I worked on tricks for the first time since we’d gotten to Oregon.  The whole week, I’ve been mostly playing it safe, cruising around and grinding but no lip tricks.  After watching Matt skate, I wanted to work on stand-up 5-0- grinds.  I spent some time working on these in the shallow bowl.  I can get into the grind, but the way I do them, my wheel hangs up, so I’m chicken to try to ride them back in.  I’m sure if I practice, I can get over this eventually.  Something to work on.  Part of why this is difficult for me is that I slammed badly once at Kenmore doing a fakie to 5-0 stall, so I have a bit of a mental block there.

<P>I was, however, doing some nice frontside 50-50 grinds on several of the walls.

<P>There were several girls skating today, including a couple of them who were pretty good skaters.  I can’t really verbalize effectively why I find female skaters so incredibly sexy, but in any case, I’m always delighted to see women skate for many reasons.  I spent some time shooting pictures and giving encouragement to Jackie and Billie as they worked on getting frontside grinds on one wall.  Jackie had it pretty much dialed, but Billie just wasn’t getting the speed to get up to the coping.  The third girl skater was a beginner, but had auburn hair, full lips, and a beautiful body whish she was showing off in pink plaid pants.  She and her boyfriend were skating together.

<P>I spent a trivial amount of time doing frontside rocks and got a few more handplants under my belt.

<P>After skating, we went by the taqueria and panaderia on the main drag, and had an awesome Mexican meal for the grand total of $11 for the three of us.

<H2>Friday, September 19, 2003</H2>
<H3> Aumsville </H3>
<P>Matt was feeling better by Friday, and he missed skating at Aumsville, so I gladly acceded to his request that we head back down to Aumsville for our last day in the state.

<P>We both had a terrific session at Aumsville.  I worked on my rock and rolls, trying to get them better extended.  Matt was carving and pumping around the park with a huge grin on his face.  It’s sort of funny – there were all kinds of bugs in the bowl.  Grasshoppers, beetles, bees.  In Northwest, Ben Krahn removes a praying mantis from the bowl, so it must be a pretty much constant thing.
<H3>Donald</H3>
<P>I was also glad to get back to Donald.  The results of my week of skating really showed, as I managed to get a foot higher in the pool than I had earlier in the week (still no coping though…).

<P>Soon, though, we started to get antsy for home.  We headed back to Dax’s and hung out with him for a couple of hours, and then we packed up the car and headed home, sad, sore, tired, and already planning our next trip down South!
