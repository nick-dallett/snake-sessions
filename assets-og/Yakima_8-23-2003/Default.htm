<H3>Yakima, WA skatepark</H3>
<P>I have to give props to the city of Yakima for stepping up and giving the kids a skatepark.  A lot of community effort went into this park.  Unfortunately, it bites the big wazoo :-(.  I'd say the park is a combination of the worst parts of Everett and Kirkland.  (And the Everett comment is giving this park a huge compliment!).

<P>The coping here is not embedded in the 'crete so much as placed on the surface.  This makes the "bowl" completely unskateable (never mind that it is shallow and has impossibly mellow transition and a flat spiral cutting through half of it!).  The half pipe is both too narrow and too tight.  The 9 foot quarter would be the best part of the park, except that there isn't anything across from it to balance it out.  I don't know how anyone gets coping up there :-).

<P>Everything else has transitions like a backyard pool - really tight, with vert at 4 feet or so.
